Maybe you are also just interested in knowing of big the software currently is, then ACQC metrics is also good for you.

Just drag &amp; drop files on its main window. Metrics are then computed and displayed in a list. The contents of the lists can be copied and pasted.
Alternatively, the tool can be driven by command line options (tool -o output.xml file-to-parse.cpp) with no gui for integration as a batch job in other tools.

Features:
-Supports following metrics:
  - LINES: the number of physical lines in your file
  - LLOC: the logical lines of code (without comments, without spaces)
  - LLOCi: the logical lines of comments (lines caontaining only comments)
  - LLOW: the logical whitespace lines (lines without any other content than whitespace characters)
  - PROCS: the number of procedures/functions inside the file
  - CARGS: the total number of arguments used by the function or functions in the file
  - CC: the cyclomatic complexity known also under McCabe complexity, represents the number of decisions taken by the code
  - DC: the "depth" complexity. If you imbricate a lot (if's inside if's or while's inside switches for example) this will get high.
- Displays a kiviat diagram
- Highlights the functions that lies outside of the normal range

The tool doesn't need any setup and does not modify your registry. The only prerequisite is to have a .NET 3.5 framework installed.</Char_Desc_2000>
