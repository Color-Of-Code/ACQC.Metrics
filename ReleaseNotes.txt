
Planned:
	- improvements to kiviat diagram
	- support for C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Php
	- make the metric bounds configurable
	- Port to WPF and background metrics update
	- Implement Maintainability index: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/codeanalysis/archive/2007/11/20/maintainability-index-range-and-meaning.aspx
	
	Maintainability Index = MAX(0,(171 - 5.2 * ln(Halstead Volume) - 0.23 * (Cyclomatic Complexity) - 16.2 * ln(Lines of Code))*100 / 171)
	0-9 = Red
	10-19 = Yellow
	20-100 = Green
	


I tried to run ACQC from the command line within a script and caused a crash.

 

 

Calling it for each file (as in the example on the website) works:

%TOOLSDIR%\acqc\ACQC.Metrics.exe -o %OUTDIR%\acqcOutput.xml %SRCDIR%\main.c

                Stepping through a list of files in a batch script has the problem of giving multiple metric reports for multiple files and inserts performance issues

 

Using a list of wildcards causes a crash:

%TOOLSDIR%\acqc\ACQC.Metrics.exe -o %OUTDIR%\acqcOutput.xml %FILES%

 

This file list CAN be used with cccc (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cccc/) and is defined as:

SET C_FILES= %SRCDIR%\*.c %SRCDIR%\driver\*.c %SRCDIR%\states\*.c %SRCDIR%\signals\in\*.c %SRCDIR%\signals\out\*.c

SET H_FILES= %SRCDIR%\*.h %SRCDIR%\driver\*.h %SRCDIR%\states\*.h %SRCDIR%\signals\in\*.h %SRCDIR%\signals\out\*.h

SET FILES= %C_FILES% %H_FILES%

 

 

It would be nice to have one report for a whole SW-project, so ACQC should

-          accept multiple files and multiple wildcards (so it is easy to use it together with cccc)

OR

-          enable a recursive checking mode from a starting directory (as ACQC does when I drag and drop a directory in the GUI)

 

 

1.0.5 - 2011-
	- Fixed crash on start due to the detection of Notepad++
	- Extension of the command line support, support of wildcards, several source files per XML
	
1.0.4 - 2011-02-26
	- fixed opening of read-only files
    - added license text into GUI
    - colored items according to their metrics
	- double clicking on one item opens it in notepad++ at the right line (if notepad++ detected)
	- added extensible editor list (with request per email for missing support)
	- basic Kiviat diagram
